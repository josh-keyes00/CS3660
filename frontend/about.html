    <h1>About Wizz Wizards Worldwide</h1>
    <p>
      At <strong>Wizz Wizards Worldwide</strong>, we exist to meet every wizarding need imaginable — 
      from powerful enchantments and world-shaping spells to potions that can heal, empower, or (accidentally) 
      turn your mayor into a frog. As the <em>leading wizarding company in the world</em>, we pride ourselves on 
      delivering magical solutions that are as reliable as they are spectacular. Whether you’re a kingdom in 
      crisis or a small adventuring party needing a boost, Wizz Wizards Worldwide is here to provide enchantment, 
      spellcraft, and alchemy of the highest order.
    </p>

    <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Professor Archibald Percival the Seventeenth of Lower Mossbottomshire</strong> –  
      The legendary <em>Spell Master</em> of Wizz Wizards Worldwide. Archibald has seen more battles than most 
      libraries have books, including leading the defense against the Invasions of the Nine Hells where he 
      personally banished three balor generals back to their fiery pits. His spell mastery ranges from apocalyptic 
      firestorms to intricate protective wards, and his combat record includes slaying no fewer than seven dragons. 
      Today, he ensures that our spellmaking services remain unmatched, from simple charms to reality-warping incantations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sir Bartholomew Von Quagmire III, Keeper of the Sacred Binder Clips</strong> –  
      Our <em>Enchanting Specialist</em>. Sir Bartholomew has enchanted everything from swords to quills to entire 
      castles — and on one famous occasion, the royal outhouse (don’t ask). During the Siege of Silverkeep, he 
      enchanted an army’s armor to sparkle so brightly it blinded the enemy into surrender. With centuries of 
      enchanting expertise, Bartholomew ensures that Wizz Wizards Worldwide delivers magical enhancements that 
      dazzle, protect, and inspire.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Dame Esmeralda Fantasia Sprocket of the Glittering Marshes</strong> –  
      The <em>Potion Master Supreme</em>. Esmeralda has brewed everything from elixirs that grant the strength 
      of ten giants to potions that can cure plagues in a single sip. She once fueled an entire dwarven workforce 
      for twelve straight years with her infamous <em>Elixir of Eternal Mondays</em>. During the Dragon Wars, 
      her volatile concoctions brought down wyverns mid-flight. At Wizz Wizards Worldwide, she heads potion 
      development, ensuring our brews are both legendary and—mostly—safe.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
